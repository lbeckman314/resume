To Whom it May Concern,

\vspace*{\baselineskip}

The Cancer Early Detection Advanced Research center at OHSU sets a high standard for an open and collaborative research and analysis group. Accurate and precise data management and analysis is a key component of this standard. To aid in this project such that my contributions may assist the researchers and ultimately the patients that the Computational Biology Program serves would be a tremendous honor.
