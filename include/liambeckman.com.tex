A website that presents a variety of my projects and software development tools, including \href{https://git.liambeckman.com}{a Git server} and an instance of \href{https://liambeckman.com/jenkins}{Jenkins continuous integration service}. The website and all projects are hosted on a modest single-board computer (Raspbian on RPi3 Model B).
