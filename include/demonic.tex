{Interactive demos of programs and programming languages.}
{Node.js, JavaScript, Go}
{2018 --- Present}

A suite of applications that allows users to try out programs and programming languages by accessing a \textcolor{my-blue}{\href{https://liambeckman.com/code\#terminal}{simple web interface}}, \textcolor{my-blue}{\href{https://demo.liambeckman.com/docs.html}{reading documentation}}, or even experimenting from the \textcolor{my-blue}{\href{https://github.com/lbeckman314/demonic-cli.git}{command line}}. Processes are communicated via WebSockets and run in a lightweight Linux sandbox (Debian chroot secured with \textcolor{my-blue}{\href{https://firejail.wordpress.com/}{Firejail}}).
