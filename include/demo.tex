A pseudo-terminal that sends user input to a Node.js server via websockets. If the user input matches a predefined or available command, the server spawns a sandboxed child process that executes the command. This allows users with internet access to try out programs and programming languages by accessing a simple web app, reading documentation, or even experimenting from the command line.
