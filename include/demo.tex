Created a suite of remote applications to allow users to try out programs and programming languages by accessing a \textcolor{my-blue}{\href{https://voyager-index.herokuapp.com}{simple web app}}, \textcolor{my-blue}{\href{https://demo.liambeckman.com/docs-demonstration.html}{reading documentation}}, or even experimenting from the \textcolor{my-blue}{\href{https://github.com/lbeckman314/demo-cli.git}{command line}}. Processes are communicated via WebSockets and run in a lightweight Linux sandbox (currently a Debian chroot secured with \textcolor{my-blue}{\href{https://firejail.wordpress.com/}{Firejail}}).
