    components on personal server.

DEMO* — terminal emulator emulator that allows users to try out
programs.
Node.js, JavaScript, Go github.com/lbeckman314/demo

Created a suite of remote applications to allow users to try out
programs and programming languages by accessing a simple web app,
reading documentation, or even experimenting from the command line.
Processes are communicated via WebSockets and run in a lightweight Linux
sandbox (currently a Debian chroot secured with Firejail).

WITHFEATHERS* — poetry web app and shell program. "’Hope’ is the thing
